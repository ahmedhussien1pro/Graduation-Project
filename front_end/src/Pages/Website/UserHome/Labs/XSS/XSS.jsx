                        (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that
                        allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that
                        users have with a vulnerable application.

                        It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin

                      Most websites and web applications run client-side code in
                      the web browser using some kind of dynamic scripting
                      language. In a vast majority of cases, this language is
                      <b className="content__code">JavaScript.</b>{" "}
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>
                      Pure <b className="content__code">HTML</b> websites and
                      web applications still exist, but they are a rare sight
                      simply because client-side scripts greatly enhance the
                      user interface and capabilities of the website or web
                      application.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>
                      You can safely assume that more than 99% of websites and
                      web applications you come across include client-side
                      JavaScript code.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li>
                      This, in turn, means that user browsers must be able to
                      interpret any <b className="content__code">JavaScript</b>{" "}
                      code on behalf of the web application.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li>
                      Most web applications and websites also interact with
                      users in some way, even if they don’t use{" "}
                      <b className="content__code">JavaScript</b>.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                      />
                      Interaction requires some form of user input.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                      />
                      For example, the user may need to type their username to
                      log in to the web application and the application may
                      display that <b className="content__subtitle">username</b>{" "}
                      later in the user interface.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li>
                      This means that the application processes user input and
                      then outputs it in the web browser.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li>
                      Combined, these two conditions lay the foundation for the
                      most common web security vulnerability – cross-site
                      scripting, which is a type of injection attack.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li>
                      If an attacker is able to include{" "}
                      <b className="content__code">JavaScript</b> code in a user
                      input parameter and the application directly returns that
                      code in its HTML output and sends it to the client
                      browser, the browser will execute the malicious
                      <b className="content__code">JavaScript</b>.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li>
                      Whenever a web page directly echoes user input, attackers
                      will be able to run malicious scripts in the client
                      browser, even if the page itself is built only with static
                      HTML tags and includes no{" "}
                      <b className="content__code">JavaScript</b>.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li>
                      Unlike most other web application vulnerabilities, this
                      one does not directly affect the back end of the
                      application (the web server).
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li>
                      It affects regular users of the web application or victims
                      who are tricked into accessing it.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li>
                      XSS is also possible for some APIs that allow{" "}
                      <b className="content__code">JavaScript</b>, for example,
                      an API may present the user with an error message that
                      contains <b className="content__code">JavaScript</b>{" "}
                      previously injected by an attacker.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li>
                      For many years, cross-site scripting had its own separate
                      category in the OWASP Top 10.
                    </li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li>
                      However, in 2021, the creators of the list decided to
                      incorporate it into the Injection category along with{" "}

                    <li>
                      Here is a simple example of a reflected XSS vulnerability:
                      <Link

                    <li>
                      The application doesn't perform any other processing of
                      the data, so an attacker can easily construct an attack
                      like this:

                        to="https://insecure-website.com/status?message=<script>/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/</script><p>Status: <script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>"

                    <li>
                      If the user visits the URL constructed by the attacker,
                      then the attacker's script executes in the user's browser,
                      in the context of that user's session with the

                      (also known as persistent or second-order XSS) arises when

                    <li>
                      The data in question might be submitted to the application
                      via HTTP requests; for example, comments on a blog post,
                      user nicknames in a chat room, or contact details on a
                      customer order.

                    <li>
                      In other cases, the data might arrive from other untrusted
                      sources; for example, a webmail application displaying
                      messages received over SMTP, a marketing application
                      displaying social media posts, or a network monitoring
                      application displaying packet data from network traffic.

                    <li>
                      Here is a simple example of a stored XSS vulnerability. A
                      message board application lets users submit messages,
                      which are displayed to other users:
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>
                      <h2 className="content__title">Example</h2>
                    </li>
                    <pre>
                      <code className="content__code">
                        <span>
                          &lt;p&gt;Hello, this is my message!&lt;/p&gt;
                        </span>
                      </code>
                    </pre>
                    <li>
                      The application doesn't perform any other processing of
                      the data, so an attacker can easily send a message that
                      attacks other users:
                    </li>
                    <pre>

                      (also known as DOM XSS) arises when an application
                      contains some client-side JavaScript that processes data
                      from an untrusted source in an unsafe way, usually by
                      writing the data back to the DOM.

                        className="me-2 text-warning"
                      />
                      In the following example, an application uses some
                      JavaScript to read the value from an input field and write
                      that value to an element within the HTML:
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <pre>

                          var search = document.getElementById('search').value;
                        </span>
                      </code>
                      <br></br>
                      <code className="content__code">
                        <span>
                          var results = document.getElementById('results');
                        </span>
                      </code>
                      <br></br>
                      <code className="content__code">
                        <span>
                          results.innerHTML = 'You searched for: ' + search;
                        </span>
                      </code>
                      <br></br>
                    </pre>

                      />
                      If the attacker can control the value of the input field,
                      they can easily construct a malicious value that causes
                      their own script to execute:
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <pre>
                      <code className="content__code">

                    <li className="xss-style-li">
                      In a typical case, the input field would be populated from
                      part of the HTTP request, such as a URL query string
                      parameter, allowing the attacker to deliver an attack
                      using a malicious URL, in the same manner as reflected
                      XSS.

                      The 2005 Samy worm – in October 2005, Samy Kamkar, a user
                      of the MySpace social media platform, created an
                      experiment that was supposed to be a fun prank and turned
                      into a nightmare. He included JavaScript code in the
                      content of a MySpace message board post. When Samy’s page
                      was visited by anyone, this code would be executed by the
                      user browser and would post the same comment to the
                      victim’s profile. Within 20 hours, the XSS worm reached
                      over one million MySpace users. For his prank, Kamkar was
                      raided in 2006 by the US Secret Service and ended up with
                      a plea agreement – three years probation with no access to
                      the Internet.

                      In 2011, attackers used a Facebook XSS vulnerability to
                      launch a self-propagating spam worm similar to the
                      original Samy worm. The vulnerability was located in the
                      Facebook Mobile API. The attackers created a web page with
                      a specially crafted iframe element that forced all
                      visiting Facebook users to post unauthorized messages on
                      their walls, getting more users to visit the same page.
                      This was one of many XSS vulnerabilities on social media
                      sites, and others continue to surface even today.

                      The British Airways 2018 breach – this was probably the
                      most famous XSS breach so far that led to the theft of
                      sensitive data. The attackers, suspected to be part of the
                      Magecart organization, used an XSS vulnerability to skim
                      personal and payment information of up to 380,000 British
                      Airways customers. While it was not a classic stored XSS
                      attack, the attackers managed to place malicious scripts
                      on British Airways payment websites that sent sensitive
                      information to a server under the attackers’ control.
                      Similar Magecart attacks happened before and keep
                      happening even today but usually, the scope of the attack
                      is narrower.

                      can steal sensitive information, such as passwords, credit

                      Attackers can hijack user accounts by stealing
                      authentication cookies or manipulating session data. This
                      allows them to access the user's account and perform
                      actions on their behalf.

                      Preventing cross-site scripting is trivial in some cases
                      but can be much harder depending on the complexity of the
                      application and the ways it handles user-controllable
                      data.

                      In general, effectively preventing XSS vulnerabilities is
                      likely to involve a combination of the following measures:
                    </li>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <h2 className="content__title">
                          Filter input on arrival:{" "}
                        </h2>
                        At the point where user input is received, filter as
                        strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid
                        input.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <h2 className="content__title">
                          Encode data on output:{" "}
                        </h2>
                        At the point where user-controllable data is output in
                        HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from
                        being interpreted as active content. Depending on the
                        output context, this might require applying combinations
                        of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <h2 className="content__title">
                          Use appropriate response headers:{" "}
                        </h2>
                        To prevent XSS in HTTP responses that aren't intended to
                        contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can use the{" "}
                        <span>Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options </span>{" "}
                        headers to ensure that browsers interpret the responses
                        in the way you intend.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <h2 className="content__title">
                          Content Security Policy:{" "}
                        </h2>
                        As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security
                        Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS
                        vulnerabilities that still occur.
