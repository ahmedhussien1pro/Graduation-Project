                      Most web applications use simple unique identifiers to
                      reference server-side objects. For example, a user in a
                      database will usually be referred to via a unique user ID.
                      The same user ID is the primary key to the database column
                      containing user information, and it is generated
                      automatically. The database key generation algorithm is
                      based on simple incrementing – it usually uses the next
                      available integer. The same database ID generation
                      mechanisms are used for all other types of database
                      records.

                        className="me-2 text-warning"
                      />
                      Such IDs often see client-side use by web applications and
                      APIs. When sent in URLs via regular HTTP requests using
                      the GET method, the IDs are clearly visible both in the
                      web browser and in request headers, which makes them
                      easily accessible to attackers. Referring directly to
                      internal IDs in this way is not recommended for security
                      reasons because it could enable attackers to perform
                      extensive enumeration (for example, find all user IDs). If
                      there is no other way of referring to an internal object,
                      the developer must at least ensure access control so
                      resource access requires more than just a reference and
                      generic page authentication.

                        className="me-2 text-warning"
                      />
                      For example, let’s say that a web application displays
                      transaction details using the following URL:
                      <span className="secure-link">
                        https://www.example.com/transaction.php?id=74656
                      </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <FontAwesomeIcon

                        className="me-2 text-warning"
                      />
                      A malicious hacker could try tampering with the id
                      parameter value and substituting other, similar values for
                      74656, for example:
                      <span className="secure-link">
                        https://www.example.com/transaction.php?id=74657
                      </span>
                      Depending on the application, transaction 74657 could be a
                      valid transaction associated with another user account,
                      and the malicious hacker should not be authorized to see
                      it. However, if the developer failed to implement
                      authorization checks before granting access to the
                      transaction, the attacker may be able to see it. In that
                      case, we would have an

                      password change forms. A badly designed password change

                      You might get this URL in a confirmation email after first
                      providing an email address using a different form. If
                      there are no additional checks, a malicious hacker could
                      try the above URL with userid=1, thus potentially gaining
                      access to the administrator account (the ID of the
                      administrator is often 1).

                      Insecure direct object references are a type of access
                      control vulnerability that cannot be directly detected
                      using automated security testing tools (except in the
                      special case of path traversal vulnerabilities). Because
                      you can’t use vulnerability scanning to find them,
                      identifying IDORs requires manual penetration testing and
                      security-focused code reviews.

                      />
                      The only way to protect against IDORs is to implement
                      strict access control checks for all sensitive objects.
                      Luckily, modern back-end development frameworks such as
                      Ruby on Rails or Django don’t have problems with IDOR
                      (unless the software developer decides to use their own
                      access mechanisms rather than the built-in ones). With
                      such frameworks, access control is implemented securely by
                      design, so it is best practice to use reputable frameworks
                      to develop your web applications and follow their
                      documented methods of object access control. If that is
                      not possible, you should use secure cryptographic hashes
                      of your identifiers instead of using the identifiers
                      directly.

                      You may see some sources saying that to prevent IDOR
                      vulnerabilities, you should use long, hard-to-guess object
                      identifiers, such as the ones used for session management
                      or UUIDs. A related solution is to use indirect object
                      reference maps with external IDs that are hard to guess.
                      However, we strongly advise against using any such
                      approaches because they give you a false sense of security
                      while only making attacks harder but not impossible.
