                      <span className="content__subtitle me-2">Hashing</span> is a one-way function that takes a
                      string of any length and returns a fixed-length string.
                      The output of the function is called a hash. Hashing is
                      used to verify the integrity of data. It is also used to
                      store passwords in a database. The hash of a password is
                      stored in the database instead of the password itself.
                      This way, if the database is compromised, the attacker
                      will have a hard time getting the passwords.

                      that turns data into a string of nondescript text that

                      cybersecurity,
                      <span className="content__subtitle me-2">hashing</span> is a way to keep sensitive
                      information and data — including passwords, messages, and
                      documents — secure. Once this content is converted via a
                      hashing algorithm, the resulting value (or hash code) is
                      unreadable to humans and extremely difficult to decrypt,
                      even with the help of advanced technology. Hashing has
                      become an important cybersecurity tool for organizations,
                      especially given the rise in remote work and use of
                      personal devices. Both of these trends require
                      organizations to leverage

                      technology to enable a remote workforce and reduce
                      friction within the user experience. Though this is a
                      necessary part of modern business, attackers have come to
                      recognize the inherent vulnerability of stored passwords
                      and user credentials, which means that companies must take
                      additional steps to keep that information secure.

                          The recipient then takes the resulting hash value and
                          applies the same hash function; if the hash values
                          match, it proves that the message has not been altered
                          and that it originated with the designated sender

                      Though digital signatures are often used to secure email
                      and other digital communications, they can also
                      authenticate and verify any kind of electronic transaction
                      or document. Two main use cases are:

                            Document comparisons:
                          </span>
                          During hashing, the hash function will produce a
                          fixed-value character string that serves as a unique
                          identifier for any type of document or file. If the
                          document is altered in any way, even minutely, the
                          hash value will also change. As a result, hashing
                          provides a fast and effective way to compare files and
                          confirm they have not been altered or compromised.
                          Data integrity verification: To verify the integrity
                          of the data within a file or document, a hashing
                          algorithm can be used to produce a checksum, which is
                          a hash value that reflects the sum of the dataset.
                          This checksum accompanies the data as it is shared or
                          transmitted. Upon receipt, the user can create a new
                          checksum and compare it to the original. If the two
                          values match, then the data is considered secure.

                          Hashing is a critical part of identity and access
                          management (IAM) tools. By using a hashing tool,
                          organizations can ensure the identity of their users
                          and maintain proper access controls. This helps
                          prevent password-based attacks, such as password
                          spraying or credential theft.

                          challenge and must implement a solution to prevent
                          such collisions. For example, a company might
                          implement a chaining strategy, which is when a

                          Hashing can be a bit of a balancing act. Algorithms
                          are designed to optimize both speed and memory use;
                          they must also be able to support the level of data
                          input needed by the company. This creates significant
                          complexity in terms of algorithm design and evolution.
                          With respect to cybersecurity, a slow algorithm or one
                          facing significant backlogs can translate into higher
                          risk.

                          By definition, hashing is a one-way conversion of data
                          into an indecipherable string of text. Generally, it
                          is impossible to reconvert the hash value back to
                          data. However, some sophisticated adversaries can
                          either discover or guess the hash function, which
                          would allow them to reverse engineer the hash values
                          or tamper with the dataset by creating fake inputs.

                      Though hashing and encryption may seem to result in the

                      The main difference is that <span className="content__subtitle me-2">Hashing</span> is always
                      intended to be a one-way conversion of data. The hash
                      value is a unique string of text that can only be decoded
                      if the adversary is able to steal or guess the hash
                      function and then reverse engineer the data input.

                      Another key difference is that <span className="content__subtitle me-2">Hashing</span>
                      provides you with the ability to authenticate data,
                      messages, files, or other assets. Users can confirm that
                      data sent from one user to another has not been
                      intercepted and altered by comparing the original hash
                      value with the one produced by the recipient. With
                      encrypted data, on the other hand, there is no way to
                      validate the data or tell if it has been changed, which is
                      why hashing is preferred for authentication purposes.

                        Compare & Contrast: Encryption vs. Hashing

                      Both hashing and encryption scramble data to protect it
                      from hackers. But the way the data is scrambled, and what
                      happens with it after encoding, is different.
