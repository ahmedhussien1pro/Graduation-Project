                  <p>All dynamic websites are composed of APIs, so classic web vulnerabilities like SQL injection could be classed as API testing. In this topic, we'll teach you how to test APIs that aren't fully used by the website front-end, with a focus on RESTful and JSON APIs. We'll also teach you how to test for server-side parameter pollution vulnerabilities that may impact internal APIs.</p>

                      In this section, we'll introduce the concept of API
                      testing, focusing on how APIs enable communication between
                      different software systems and why testing them is crucial
                      for identifying vulnerabilities. We'll dive into API
                      recon, the importance of understanding API documentation,
                      and how to identify potential weaknesses in APIs,
                      especially RESTful and JSON APIs. Lastly, weâ€™ll give you

                    security and functionality of modern web applications.
                    APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow systems to
                    communicate and share data, but flawed APIs can lead to
                    vulnerabilities that compromise a website's security. APIs
                    are often used in dynamic websites, and testing them
                    ensures that common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or
                    parameter pollution are prevented. This section will help
                    you understand the role of API testing in maintaining the
                    confidentiality, integrity, and availability of web
                    applications.

                    To begin testing an API, you need to understand how it

                  <p>Documentation can be in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. Human-readable documentation is designed for developers to understand how to use the API. It may include detailed explanations, examples, and usage scenarios. Machine-readable documentation is designed to be processed by software for automating tasks like API integration and validation. It's written in structured formats like JSON or XML.</p>
                  <p>API documentation is often publicly available, particularly if the API is intended for use by external developers. If this is the case, always start your recon by reviewing the documentation.</p>
                  <p>
                    API documentation provides developers with the information
                    needed to interact with the API. This documentation can be
                    human-readable (for developers) or machine-readable (for
                    automated tasks). Even if API documentation is not publicly
                    available, you can use tools to uncover hidden documentation
                    by crawling through the application.

                  <b className="content__title">Identifying API endpoints </b>
                  <p>
                    You can also gather a lot of information by browsing applications that use the API. This is often worth doing even if you have access to API documentation, as sometimes documentation may be inaccurate or out of date.You can use Burp Scanner to crawl the application, then manually investigate interesting attack surface using Burp's browser.
                  </p>
                  <p>While browsing the application, look for patterns that suggest API endpoints in the URL structure, such as /api/. Also look out for JavaScript files. These can contain references to API endpoints that you haven't triggered directly via the web browser. Burp Scanner automatically extracts some endpoints during crawls, but for a more heavyweight extraction, use the JS Link Finder BApp. You can also manually review JavaScript files in Burp.</p>
                  <b className="content__title">Interacting with API endpoints</b>
                  <p>Once you've identified API endpoints, interact with them using Burp Repeater and Burp Intruder. This enables you to observe the API's behavior and discover additional attack surface. For example, you could investigate how the API responds to changing the HTTP method and media type.</p>
                  <p>As you interact with the API endpoints, review error messages and other responses closely. Sometimes these include information that you can use to construct a valid HTTP request.</p>
                  <b className="content__title">Identifying supported HTTP methods </b>
                  <p>The HTTP method specifies the action to be performed on a resource. For example:</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li><b className="content__subtitle me-2">GET </b>Retrieves data from a resource.</li>
                  <li><b className="content__subtitle me-2">PATCH </b>Applies partial changes to a resource.</li>
                  <li><b className="content__subtitle me-2">OPTIONS </b>Retrieves information on the types of request methods that can be used on a resource.</li>
                 </ol>
                  <p>An API endpoint may support different HTTP methods. It's therefore important to test all potential methods when you're investigating API endpoints. This may enable you to identify additional endpoint functionality, opening up more attack surface</p>
                  <p>For example, the endpoint <code className="content__code">/api/tasks</code> may support the following methods:</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li><b className="content__subtitle me-2">GET /api/tasks</b>Retrieves a list of tasks.</li>
                  <li><b className="content__subtitle me-2">POST /api/tasks</b> Creates a new task.</li>
                  <li><b className="content__subtitle me-2">DELETE /api/tasks/1</b>Deletes a task.</li>
                 </ol>
                  <b className="content__title ">Identifying supported content types </b>
                  <p>API endpoints often expect data in a specific format. They may therefore behave differently depending on the content type of the data provided in a request. Changing the content type may enable you to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowRight} className="me-2 text-warning" /> Trigger errors that disclose useful information.</li>
                  <li><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowRight} className="me-2 text-warning" /> Bypass flawed defenses.</li>
                  <li><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowRight} className="me-2 text-warning" /> Take advantage of differences in processing logic. For example, an API may be secure when handling JSON data but susceptible to injection attacks when dealing with XML.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>To change the content type, modify the Content-Type header, then reformat the request body accordingly. You can use the Content type converter BApp to automatically convert data submitted within requests between XML and JSON.</p>

                    When designing APIs, make sure that security is a consideration from the beginning. In particular, make sure that you:

                    <li> <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowRight} className="me-2 text-warning" />{" "}
                      Secure your documentation if you don't intend your API to be publicly accessible.</li>
                  <li>Ensure your documentation is kept up to date so that legitimate testers have full visibility of the API's attack surface.</li>
                  <li> <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowRight} className="me-2 text-warning" />{" "}Apply an allowlist of permitted HTTP methods.</li>
                  <li> <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowRight} className="me-2 text-warning" />{" "}Validate that the content type is expected for each request or response.</li>
                  <li> <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowRight} className="me-2 text-warning" />{" "}Use generic error messages to avoid giving away information that may be useful for an attacker.</li>
                  <li> <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowRight} className="me-2 text-warning" />{" "}protective measures on all versions of your API, not just the current production version.</li>
                 </ul>
                  <p>To prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities, allowlist the properties that can be updated by the user, and blocklist sensitive properties that shouldn't be updated by the user.</p>
