                    Welcome to a world where launching web attacks is so easy
                    that even beginners (like script kiddies) can write simple
                    scripts to hack into big businesses. These attacks are like
                    sneaky tricks that can cause much trouble online. In this
                    room, we will focus on one such web attack called Cross-Site
                    Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF). We will understand various
                    exploitation techniques of CSRF and protection measures for
                    its prevention.

                  <h3 className="content__subtitle">What is CSRF?</h3>
                  <p>
                    CSRF is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker
                    tricks a user's web browser into performing an unwanted
                    action on a trusted site where the user is authenticated.
                    This is achieved by exploiting the fact that the browser
                    includes any relevant cookies (credentials) automatically,
                    allowing the attacker to forge and submit unauthorised
                    requests on behalf of the user (through the browser). The
                    attacker's website may contain HTML forms or JavaScript code
                    that is intended to send queries to the targeted web
                    application.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="content__subtitle">Cycle of CSRF</h3>
                  <p>A CSRF attack has three essential phases:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <FontAwesomeIcon
                        icon={faArrowRight}
                        className="me-2 text-warning"
                      />
                      The attacker already knows the format of the web
                      application's requests to carry out a particular task and
                      sends a malicious link to the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <FontAwesomeIcon
                        icon={faArrowRight}
                        className="me-2 text-warning"
                      />
                      The victim's identity on the website is verified,
                      typically by cookies transmitted automatically with each
                      domain request and clicks on the link shared by the
                      attacker. This interaction could be a click, mouse over,
                      or any other action.
                      <img
                        src={Topic2}

                        className="me-2 text-warning"
                      />
                      Insufficient security measures prevent the web application
                      from distinguishing between authentic user requests and
                      those that have been falsified.

                  <h3 className="content__subtitle">Effects of CSRF</h3>
                  <p>
                    Understanding CSRF's impact is crucial for keeping online
                    activities secure. Although CSRF attacks don't directly
                    expose user data, they can still cause harm by changing
                    passwords and email addresses or making financial
                    transactions. The risks associated with CSRF include:

                      and facing legal consequences.

                  <p>
                    Conventional CSRF attacks frequently concentrate on
                    state-changing actions carried out by submitting forms. The
                    victim is tricked into submitting a form without realising
                    the associated data like cookies, URL parameters, etc. The
                    victim's web browser sends an HTTP request to a web
                    application form where the victim has already been
                    authenticated. These forms are made to transfer money,
                    modify account information, or alter an email address.

                    The above diagram shows traditional CSRF examples in the
                    following steps:
                  </p>

                      />
                      The victim is already logged on to his bank website. The
                      attackers create a crafted malicious link and email it to
                      the victim.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      {" "}

                        className="me-2 text-warning"
                      />
                      The victim opens the email in the same browser.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      {" "}

                      />
                      Once clicked, the malicious link enables the auto-transfer
                      of the amount from the victim's browser to the attacker's
                      bank account.

                  <h3 className="content__subtitle">XMLHttpRequest CSRF</h3>
                  <p>
                    An asynchronous CSRF exploitation occurs when operations are
                    initiated without a complete page request-response cycle.
                    This is typical of contemporary online apps that leverage
                    asynchronous server communication (via XMLHttpRequest or the
                    Fetch API) and JavaScript to produce more dynamic user
                    interfaces. These attacks use asynchronous calls instead of
                    the more conventional form submissions. Still, they exploit
                    the same trust relationship between the user and the online
                    service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Consider an online email client, for instance, where users
                    may change their email preferences without reloading the
                    page. If this online application is CSRF-vulnerable, a
                    hacker might create a fake asynchronous HTTP request,
                    usually a POST request, and alter the victim's email
                    preferences, forwarding all their correspondence to a
                    malicious address.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                      />
                      The victim opens a session saved in their browser's
                      cookies and logs into the{" "}

                      />
                      The attacker entices the victim to open a malicious
                      webpage with a script that can send queries to the

                      To modify the user's email forwarding preferences, the

                  <p>
                    The term "Flash-based CSRF" describes the technique of
                    conducting a CSRF attack by taking advantage of flaws in
                    Adobe Flash Player components. Internet applications with
                    features like interactive content, video streaming, and
                    intricate animationsflash based csrf have been made possible
                    with Flash. But over time, security flaws in Flash,
                    particularly those that can be used to launch CSRF attacks,
                    have become a major source of worry. As HTML5 technology
                    advanced and security flaws multiplied, official support for
                    Adobe Flash Player ceased on December 31, 2020.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though Flash is no longer supported, a talk about
                    Flash-based cross-site request forgery threats is
                    instructive, particularly for legacy systems that still rely
                    on antiquated technologies. A malicious Flash file (.swf)
                    posted on the attacker's website would typically send
                    unauthorised requests to other websites to carry out
                    Flash-based CSRF attacks.

                      Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):
                    </h3>
                    In this type of access control, access to resources is
                    determined by a set of attributes, such as user role, time
                    of day, location, and device. ABAC is commonly used in cloud
                    environments and web applications. In layman’s terms, think
                    of a highly advanced sci-fi security system that scans
                    individuals for certain attributes. Maybe it checks whether
                    they’re from a particular planet, whether they’re carrying a
                    specific device, or if they’re trying to access a resource
                    at a specific time. That’s ABAC. It’s like the smart,
                    flexible security of the future.

                    Implementing access control can help prevent security
                    breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive data. However,
                    access control is not foolproof and can be vulnerable to
                    various types of attacks, such as privilege escalation and
                    broken access control vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is
                    important to regularly review and test access control
                    mechanisms to ensure that they are working as intended.

                  <h3 className="content__subtitle">How it Works</h3>
                  <p>
                    Now, you are already connected to the VM. Let's see how the
                    attack works.
                  </p>
                  <ul>

                      />
                      The attached VM represents Josh's machine, who uses Chrome
                      to check his mailbox (http://mailbox.thm:8081) and log
                      into his bank account (http://mybank.thm:8080). Since he
                      is a financial broker by profession, he deals with many
                      financial transactions daily and keeps his accounts logged
                      into the browser.{" "}
                    </li>
                    <li>

                      />
                      The attacker somehow learns that Josh uses mybank.thm:8080
                      for transactions, and his account is always logged in.
                    </li>

                      />
                      The attacker also had an account in the same bank, so he
                      tried to log in and check for any vulnerabilities that he
                      could use to get additional cash in his account.

                      />
                      You can also log in to Firefox in the attached VM or any
                      other browser using the username GB82MYBANK5698 and
                      password GB82MYBANK5698 to understand the attacker's
                      perspective and check the source code and how the
                      client-side scripts work.

                      While scanning, he found that no additional parameter was
                      being sent from the bank app while transferring payment.

                      Here, the attacker can employ the hidden image technique
                      by simply crafting an email and luring the victim to click
                      on a link. The attacker only knows Josh's email address,
                      so he launches a social engineering attack by sending the
                      following email to him.

                      The most important thing is the image src attribute set to
                      the bank transfer page link. The attacker can hide it or
                      put a valid image with an anchor tag redirecting to the
                      bank transfer page.

                      To understand the victim's perspective, navigate to Josh's
                      mailbox at the mailbox.thm:8081 to see a new email stating
                      that he has won a trip to Dubai and to claim it, he has to
                      click on a link directed to the MyBank vulnerable page
                      without having CSRF protection.

                      Once you (in reality, the victim) click on the link, he
                      will be redirected to the bank page, and the funds will be
                      transferred automatically.

                      From a secure coder perspective, it is important to ensure
                      that each request submitted to the web server carries a
                      unique token so that the server can identify if it is
                      clicked through a valid source.

                      The bank IT team quickly identified the issue and added a

                      following code contains the updated client-side code. We
                      can see that there is an additional hidden parameter,
                      csrf_token, which will be sent to the server with each
                      request.

                    Access control is the application of constraints on who or
                    what is authorized to perform actions or access resources.
                    In the context of web applications, access control is
                    dependent on authentication and session management:

                    Broken access controls are common and often present a
                    critical security vulnerability. Design and management of
                    access controls is a complex and dynamic problem that
                    applies business, organizational, and legal constraints to a
                    technical implementation. Access control design decisions
                    have to be made by humans so the potential for errors is
                    high.
