                  <p>
                    A Red Teamer is a cybersecurity professional who simulates
                    adversarial attacks to identify vulnerabilities before
                    malicious actors can exploit them. They adopt an offensive
                    mindset to assess, challenge, and improve an organization’s
                    security posture.

                  <p>
                    A career in Red Teaming involves a mix of technical skills,
                    creative problem-solving, and continuous learning. Red
                    Teamers work across areas such as penetration testing,
                    social engineering, vulnerability assessments, and exploit
                    development.
