                Understanding these vulnerabilities involves identifying flaws

                     In this section, we'll introduce the concept of business
                    logic vulnerabilities and explain how they can arise due to
                    flawed assumptions about user behavior. We'll discuss the
                    potential impact of logic flaws and teach you how they can
                    be exploited. You can also practice what you've learned
                    using our interactive labs, which are based on real bugs
                    that we've encountered in the wild. Finally, we'll provide
                    some general best practices to help you prevent these kinds
                    of logic flaws arising in your own applications.

                    Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and
                    implementation of an application that allow an attacker to
                    elicit unintended behavior. This potentially enables
                    attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality to achieve
                    a malicious goal. These flaws are generally the result of
                    failing to anticipate unusual application states that may
                    occur and, consequently, failing to handle them safely.

                        In this context, the term "business logic" simply
                        refers to the set of rules that define how the
                        application operates. As these rules aren't always
                        directly related to a business, the associated
                        vulnerabilities are also known as "application logic
                        vulnerabilities" or simply "logic flaws".
                  </div>
                  <p >
                    Logic flaws are often invisible to people who aren't
                    explicitly looking for them as they typically won't be
                    exposed by normal use of the application. However, an
                    attacker may be able to exploit behavioral quirks by
                    interacting with the application in ways that developers
                    never intended. One of the main purposes of business logic
                    is to enforce the rules and constraints that were defined
                    when designing the application or functionality. Broadly
                    speaking, the business rules dictate how the application
                    should react when a given scenario occurs. This includes
                    preventing users from doing things that will have a negative
                    impact on the business or that simply don't make sense.
                    Flaws in the logic can allow attackers to circumvent these
                    rules.
                    
                  </p>
                  <p>For example, they might be able to complete a
                    transaction without going through the intended purchase
                    workflow. In other cases, broken or non-existent validation
                    of user-supplied data might allow users to make arbitrary
                    changes to transaction-critical values or submit nonsensical
                    input.</p>
                  <p>
                    By passing unexpected values into server-side logic,
                    an attacker can potentially induce the application to do
                    something that it isn't supposed to. Logic-based
                    vulnerabilities can be extremely diverse and are often
                    unique to the application and its specific functionality.
                    Identifying them often requires a certain amount of human
                    knowledge, such as an understanding of the business domain
                    or what goals an attacker might have in a given context.
                    This makes them difficult to detect using automated
                    vulnerability scanners. As a result, logic flaws are a great
                    target for bug bounty hunters and manual testers in general.

                  <h3 className="content__title">How do business logic vulnerabilities arise </h3>
                  <p>Business logic vulnerabilities can arise in a number of
                    ways. Some common causes include:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <span className="content__subtitle me-2">Incorrect assumptions about user behavior:</span>
                        Developers may make assumptions about how users will
                        interact with an application that turn out to be
                        incorrect. For example, a developer might assume that a
                        user will always follow a certain sequence of steps when
                        using a feature, but in reality, users might not behave as
                        expected. This can lead to logic flaws if the application
                        doesn't handle these unexpected behaviors correctly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span className="content__subtitle me-2">Insufficient validation of user input:</span>If an
                        application doesn't validate user input properly,
                        attackers may be able to submit unexpected values that
                        cause the application to behave in unexpected ways. For
                        example, an attacker might be able to manipulate a hidden
                        field in a form to change the price of an item in an
                        online store.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span className="content__subtitle me-2">Failure to enforce business rules:</span>If an
                        application fails to enforce the business rules that were
                        defined when designing the application, logic flaws can
                        occur. For example, an application might allow a user to
                        perform an action that should be restricted, such as
                        deleting another user's account.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    These are just a few examples of how business logic
                    vulnerabilities can arise. In general, any time an
                    application's behavior is based on assumptions that turn out
                    to be incorrect, there is the potential for logic flaws to

                        might be able to exploit a logic flaw in an e-commerce
                        application to purchase items at a reduced price.
                    </li>

                      <span className="content__subtitle me-2">Manipulating data flows:</span>Attackers may be able to
                        manipulate the flow of data within an application to

                        able to change the recipient of a payment in a banking
                        application by exploiting a logic flaw.
