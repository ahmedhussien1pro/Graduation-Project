                    OS command injection is also known as shell injection. It
                    allows an attacker to execute operating system (OS) commands
                    on the server that is running an application, and typically
                    fully compromise the application and its data. Often, an
                    attacker can leverage an OS command injection vulnerability
                    to compromise other parts of the hosting infrastructure, and
                    exploit trust relationships to pivot the attack to other
                    systems within the organization.

                    In this example, a shopping application lets the user view
                    whether an item is in stock in a particular store. This
                    information is accessed via a URL:

                    To provide the stock information, the application must query
                    various legacy systems. For historical reasons, the
                    functionality is implemented by calling out to a shell
                    command with the product and store IDs as arguments:

                    The application implements no defenses against OS command

                    The <code className="content__code">echo</code> command

                    injection. The <code className="content__code">&amp;</code>{" "}
                    character is a shell command separator. In this example, it
                    causes three separate commands to execute, one after
                    another. The output returned to the user is:

                    command from whatever follows the injection point. This
                    reduces the chance that what follows will prevent the

                    generates an email to a site administrator containing the

                    the number of ICMP packets to send. This enables you to
