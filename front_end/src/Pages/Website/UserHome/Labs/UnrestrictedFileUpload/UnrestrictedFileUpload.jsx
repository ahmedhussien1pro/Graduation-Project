                      The impact of an Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability is
                      usually high given that it facilitates code execution on
                      target systems and web applications. Malicious actors
                      might be able to escalate this to complete access by
                      uploading and executing a web shell that can run commands,
                      attack other servers, and be used as a staging point to
                      pivot to other clients in the network.

                        to place files outside of designated directory
                        locations.

                        uploaded at all.
