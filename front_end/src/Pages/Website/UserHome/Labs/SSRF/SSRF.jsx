                    Server-side request forgery is a web security vulnerability
                    that allows an attacker to cause the server-side application
                    to make requests to an unintended location.

                  <p>
                    In a typical SSRF attack, the attacker might cause the
                    server to make a connection to internal-only services within
                    the organization's infrastructure. In other cases, they may
                    be able to force the server to connect to arbitrary external
                    systems. This could leak sensitive data, such as
                    authorization credentials.

                    SSRF attacks against the server
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    In an SSRF attack against the server, the attacker causes
                    the application to make an HTTP request back to the server
                    that is hosting the application, via its loopback network
                    interface. This typically involves supplying a URL with a
                    hostname like <mark>127.0.0.1</mark> (a reserved IP address
                    that points to the loopback adapter) or{" "}
                    <mark>localhost</mark> (a commonly used name for the same
                    adapter).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, imagine a shopping application that lets the
                    user view whether an item is in stock in a particular store.
                    To provide the stock information, the application must query
                    various back-end REST APIs. It does this by passing the URL
                    to the relevant back-end API endpoint via a front-end HTTP
                    request. When a user views the stock status for an item,
                    their browser makes the following request:
                  </p>
                  <code>POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0</code>
                  <p></p>
                  <code>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>
                  <p></p>
                  <code>Content-Length: 118</code>
                  <p></p>
                  <code>
                    stockApi=http://stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/product/stock/check%3FproductId%3D6%26storeId%3D1
                  </code>
                  <p>
                    This causes the server to make a request to the specified
                    URL, retrieve the stock status, and return this to the user.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The server fetches the contents of the <mark>/admin</mark>{" "}
                    URL and returns it to the user.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An attacker can visit the <mark>/admin</mark> URL, but the
                    administrative functionality is normally only accessible to
                    authenticated users. This means an attacker won't see
                    anything of interest. However, if the request to the{" "}
                    <mark>/admin</mark> URL comes from the local machine, the
                    normal access controls are bypassed. The application grants
                    full access to the administrative functionality, because the
                    request appears to originate from a trusted location. LAB

                  <p>
                    Why do applications behave in this way, and implicitly trust
                    requests that come from the local machine? This can arise
                    for various reasons:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The access control check might be implemented in a
                      different component that sits in front of the application
                      server. When a connection is made back to the server, the
                      check is bypassed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For disaster recovery purposes, the application might
                      allow administrative access without logging in, to any
                      user coming from the local machine. This provides a way
                      for an administrator to recover the system if they lose
                      their credentials. This assumes that only a fully trusted
                      user would come directly from the server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The administrative interface might listen on a different
                      port number to the main application, and might not be
                      reachable directly by users.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    These kind of trust relationships, where requests
                    originating from the local machine are handled differently
                    than ordinary requests, often make SSRF into a critical
                    vulnerability.

                  <p>
                    In some cases, the application server is able to interact
                    with back-end systems that are not directly reachable by
                    users. These systems often have non-routable private IP
                    addresses. The back-end systems are normally protected by
                    the network topology, so they often have a weaker security
                    posture. In many cases, internal back-end systems contain
                    sensitive functionality that can be accessed without
                    authentication by anyone who is able to interact with the
                    systems.

                  <p>
                    In the previous example, imagine there is an administrative
                    interface at the back-end URL{" "}
                    <mark>https://192.168.0.68/admin</mark>. An attacker can
                    submit the following request to exploit the SSRF
                    vulnerability, and access the administrative interface:

                    Some applications block input containing hostnames like{" "}

                      switching from an http: to https: URL during the redirect
                      has been shown to bypass some anti-SSRF filters.

                    Some applications only allow inputs that match, a whitelist
                    of permitted values. The filter may look for a match at the

                    be able to bypass this filter by exploiting inconsistencies

                    It is sometimes possible to bypass filter-based defenses by
                    exploiting an open redirection vulnerability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the previous example, imagine the user-submitted URL is
                    strictly validated to prevent malicious exploitation of the
                    SSRF behavior. However, the application whose URLs are
                    allowed contains an open redirection vulnerability. Provided
                    the API used to make the back-end HTTP request supports
                    redirections, you can construct a URL that satisfies the
                    filter and results in a redirected request to the desired

                  <p>
                    For example, the application contains an open redirection
                    vulnerability in which the following URL:
                  </p>
                  <code>
                    /product/nextProduct?currentProductId=6&path=http://evil-user.net
                  </code>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <p>returns a redirection to:</p>
                  <code>http://evil-user.net</code>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    This SSRF exploit works because the application first
                    validates that the supplied stockAPI URL is on an allowed
                    domain, which it is. The application then requests the
                    supplied URL, which triggers the open redirection. It
                    follows the redirection, and makes a request to the internal
                    URL of the attacker's choosing.

                    Many server-side request forgery vulnerabilities are easy to
                    find, because the application's normal traffic involves
                    request parameters containing full URLs. Other examples of
                    SSRF are harder to locate.

                  <h2 className="content__title">Partial URLs in requests</h2>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes, an application places only a hostname or part of
                    a URL path into request parameters. The value submitted is
                    then incorporated server-side into a full URL that is
                    requested. If the value is readily recognized as a hostname
                    or URL path, the potential attack surface might be obvious.
                    However, exploitability as full SSRF might be limited
                    because you do not control the entire URL that gets
                    requested.
                  </p>
                  <p>URLs within data formats</p>
                  <p>
                    Some applications transmit data in formats with a
                    specification that allows the inclusion of URLs that might
                    get requested by the data parser for the format. An obvious
                    example of this is the XML data format, which has been
                    widely used in web applications to transmit structured data
                    from the client to the server. When an application accepts
                    data in XML format and parses it, it might be vulnerable to
                    XXE injection. It might also be vulnerable to SSRF via XXE.
                    We'll cover this in more detail when we look at XXE
                    injection vulnerabilities.

                    SSRF via the Referer header
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Some applications use server-side analytics software to
                    tracks visitors. This software often logs the Referer header
                    in requests, so it can track incoming links. Often the
                    analytics software visits any third-party URLs that appear
                    in the Referer header. This is typically done to analyze the
                    contents of referring sites, including the anchor text that
                    is used in the incoming links. As a result, the Referer
                    header is often a useful attack surface for SSRF
                    vulnerabilities.
